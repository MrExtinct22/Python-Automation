Command Line Emailer:
Write a program that takes an email address and string of text on the command line and then, using Selenium, logs into your email account and sends an email of the string to the provided address. (You might want to set up a separate email account for this program.)
This would be a nice way to add a notification feature to your programs. You could also write a similar program to send messages from a Facebook or Twitter account.



Image Site Downloader
Write a program that goes to a photo-sharing site like Flickr or Imgur, searches for a category of photos, and then downloads all the resulting images. You could write a program that works with any photo site that has a search feature.



2048
2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down, left, or right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score by repeatedly sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over again. Write a program that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to automatically play the game.



Link Verification
Write a program that, given the URL of a web page, will attempt to download every linked page on the page. The program should flag any pages that have a 404 “Not Found” status code and print them out as broken links.

Code:

import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# User input for recipient, subject, and body of the email as well as login information
email_username = input('What is your username?\n')
email_password = input('What is your password?\n')
email_recipient = input('Who would you like to send an email to?\n')
email_subject = input('What is the subject of the email?\n')
email_body = input('What would you like to say?\n')



browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.maximize_window()
browser.implicitly_wait(30)
browser.get('http://mail.google.com')
login_elem = browser.find_element_by_id('identifierId')
login_elem.send_keys(email_username)
next_elem = browser.find_element_by_id('identifierNext')
next_elem.click()
time.sleep(3)
password_elem = browser.find_element_by_name('password')
password_elem.send_keys(email_password)
pw_next_elem = browser.find_element_by_id('passwordNext')
pw_next_elem.click()
time.sleep(3)



html_elem = browser.find_element_by_tag_name('html')
html_elem.send_keys('c')
html_elem.send_keys(Keys.TAB)
html_elem.send_keys(email_recipient)
html_elem.send_keys(Keys.TAB)
html_elem.send_keys(email_subject)
html_elem.send_keys(Keys.TAB)
html_elem.send_keys(email_body)
html_elem.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

print('Email was sent.')
